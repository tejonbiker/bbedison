# bbedison

The concept of the Intel Edison is great, but require skills (some skills are very advanced) to start working with this tiny invention.

The concept of  [Sparkfun Blocks](https://www.sparkfun.com/search/results?term=sparkfun+blocks) is great, but lack the access to all the pins of the Edison (else you will require several blocks).

The Arduino board is a great way to start with intel edison, but is to big and breaks the escence of the edison, besides that, this board don't have access to all pins of the Edison.

So, is necesary to build a very expensive PCB (with very small traces and very [small connector](http://www.adafruit.com/product/2227)) to do an advanced prototype of the Intel Edison? 

The response is: not, here is where the [Minibreakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13025) of the Intel Edison enters to the rescue, but not alone.

The mini breakout is not [breadboard](https://cdn.sparkfun.com//assets/parts/1/0/0/1/1/13025-03.jpg) friendly, but have others adavantages:

      -Lipo management (charge and regulators)
      -Serial and OTG connections
      -Power Up sequence management

BBedison is a series of PCB that allows (in conjunction with Edison minibreakout ) prototype in a more friendly way.

The best of all:

      -It's cheap: BBEdison base cost 5 USD (Yes 5 USD and you are ready to plug in in your breadboard)
      -It's very easy to do it in your home
      

Eager to start experimenting? check it out the  BBEdison base.
